# Todoc is a command line todo list.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/laserswald/todoc.png)](https://travis-ci.org/laserswald11/todoc)

## Basic use:

* Add a task with `todoc add "Herp a derp"` or `todoc -a "Herp a derp"`

* Remove a task with `todoc rm 1` or `todoc -r 1`

* Complete a task with `todoc do 1` or `todoc -d 1`

* Search for a task with `todoc search "Search string"` or `todoc -s "Search string"`. 

## Building:

Building Todoc is easy. Use the classic

    make

to build the program. Installation hasn't been placed into the makefile (yet!) but I'm working on it.

## Changelog:

+ fixed a bug from do command for double free of closing file

* **0.2.1**:
    + Fixed some bugs involving file opening and closing.
    + Fixed a really strange deallocation bug with deallocating things multiple times (I don't even.) 
    + New, hopefully more reliable (certainly more testable) seperation of Tasklist into a layer over a generic linked list.

*  **0.2**: Major restructuring into objects.
    + Cleaner, more friendly output. (Issue 3)
    + Addition of "-v" and "-f" options.
    + Asks for confirmation of removal (Issue 3)
    + Fixed bug where the program crashes if search string not found (Issue 2)
    - Option parser is no longer ugly (Issue 5)
    - Remove task fixed (Issue 7, 11)
    - Appending a task conserves memory
    - Error system makes program return failure if something bad happens
    - Added testing code for most of the library

## Dependencies
*  glibc (for regex.h in task.c)
